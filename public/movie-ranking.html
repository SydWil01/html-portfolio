<h3>Seven (The One With Brad Pitt)</h3>
<p>Very sad but really good mystery movie; kept my attention the whole time</p>
<h3>Soul</h3>
<p>Cute Disney movie that speaks on appreciating the life you have and not focusing too much on what you don't' supr cute!</p>
<h3>Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Bro the art is amazing, the colors really emulate the tone so well. Better than the OG in my opinion.</p>
